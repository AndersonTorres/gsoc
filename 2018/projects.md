# Ideas for 2018 GSOC projects

We don't know the deadline yet. Based on the 2017 deadline it'll
probably be beginning of February.

## Make the hnix nix interpreter work with nixpkgs.

We have a
[Nix interpreter written in Haskell](https://github.com/jwiegley/hnix)
but it can't currently build derivations. The idea is to make it fully nix compatible.

## Define and document API to nix-daemon

## Graphical installer for NixOS

Automated partition setup and other fancy stuff.


## langserver.org implementation for nix

http://langserver.org/ - would solve a bunch of IDE problems, though
not indentation and syntax highlighting. Might be too complicated.
